Answer for Part 5: Create Constructor method

- In Java, a class can have multiple constructors.
- Each constructor must have a different parameter list 
(number, type, or order of parameters).

In this code: 
	public class DigitalVideoDisc {

    		private String title;
    		private String category;

    		// Constructor 1: create DVD by title
    		public DigitalVideoDisc(String title) {
        		this.title = title;
    		}

    		// Constructor 2: create DVD by category and title
    		public DigitalVideoDisc(String category, String title) {
        		this.category = category;
        		this.title = title;
    		}

	}

- Both constructors above are valid because their parameter lists are different.
- If two constructors have exactly the same parameter types and order, 
Java will not allow it (duplicate constructor error).

=> Inconclusion, Java allows creating multiple constructors such as “by title”,
“by category”, etc., as long as their parameter lists are different 
  — this feature is called constructor overloading.
